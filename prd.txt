# Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
**LLM-Based Git Repository Creation Agent** (Updated)

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered agent capable of creating and managing Git repositories, generating documentation, and producing code in multiple languages (e.g., Python, C#). The agent should fully autonomously generate **all** necessary source code files and documentation to meet customer-defined requirements, while ensuring the project’s architecture conforms to a **provided project template** that may differ based on the selected programming language.

### 1.1 Purpose

The primary purpose of this agent is to **streamline the initial setup of new software projects** and **fulfill specific requirements** defined by the customer:

- Create or initialize a Git repository.  
- Generate **all** relevant project files and directories (including documentation such as `README.md`).  
- Autonomously generate source code in Python, C#, or other supported languages based on **predefined templates** and user-provided requirements.  
- Ensure the architecture of the project is **compliant with a provided project template** that depends on the chosen language.  
- Commit and push these changes to a remote repository, delivering a fully functional starter project with minimal manual effort.

### 1.2 Goals and Objectives

- **Complete Automation**: Eliminate the need for manual file creation and setup.  
- **Requirements Fulfillment**: Generate **all** source code needed to meet the customer’s specific requirements.  
- **Template Compliance**: Adhere to the structure dictated by language-specific templates.  
- **Consistency**: Enforce standard folder structures, naming conventions, and best practices.  
- **Scalability**: Offer straightforward expansion to additional languages and advanced code-generation features.

## 2. Product Scope

### 2.1 In-Scope

1. **LLM Integration**  
   - Ability to prompt a Large Language Model for generating and modifying **all** necessary files (code, documentation, etc.).  
   - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant boilerplates or templates.

2. **Git Operations**  
   - Initialize a repository or clone existing ones locally.  
   - Add commits and push changes to a remote (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  
   - Provide basic branch control.

3. **File and Directory Handling**  
   - Create directory structures and files (including documentation) **autonomously** based on user requirements.  
   - Leverage a **provided project template** that might vary by language (Python, C#, etc.).  
   - Write or modify individual files (e.g., `README.md`, source code files).

4. **Code Generation**  
   - Support generating source code **in full** for Python, C#, and potentially more languages.  
   - Ensure the **architecture** of the generated project is compliant with the relevant template.  
   - Incorporate user requirements (e.g., classes, functions, modules) into the code automatically.

5. **Documentation Generation**  
   - Produce or update a `README.md` and additional documentation as needed.  
   - Insert references to project requirements, usage instructions, or architecture details.

### 2.2 Out of Scope

1. **Advanced CI/CD**  
   - End-to-end pipeline creation (multi-stage Docker builds, complex test workflows) is not included in this initial version.  
2. **In-depth Code Quality & Security Analysis**  
   - Linting or security scanning can be added later, but the main focus is generation rather than analysis.  
3. **Complex Merge and Conflict Resolution**  
   - Advanced workflows (multi-branch merges, conflict resolution) are beyond the initial scope.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. **Repository Management**  
   - **FR1**: The system **must** initialize or clone a local Git repository for the project if one does not exist.  
   - **FR2**: The system **must** allow adding a remote origin and pushing changes (including specific branches).  
   - **FR3**: The system **must** support commit messages that reflect the operation or milestone.

2. **Template Compliance**  
   - **FR4**: The system **must** strictly adhere to the **provided project template**—which can be language-specific—and replicate its architecture.  
   - **FR5**: The system **must** dynamically select the correct template based on user input (e.g., Python vs. C#).  
   - **FR6**: The system **must** create directories and placeholder files from the chosen template, ensuring consistent naming and structure.

3. **Source Code Generation**  
   - **FR7**: The LLM **must** be able to produce **all** necessary code in Python, C#, or other specified languages to satisfy user requirements.  
   - **FR8**: The agent **must** autonomously generate or modify multiple files (e.g., `app.py`, `Program.cs`, `Dockerfile`, etc.) without requiring manual creation.  
   - **FR9**: The agent’s generated code **must** align with the structure and standards defined in the chosen template (e.g., naming conventions, folder layout).

4. **Documentation**  
   - **FR10**: The system **must** generate or update a `README.md` describing the project overview, setup instructions, and usage.  
   - **FR11**: The system **should** produce additional documentation files (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`) if specified by the user or the template.  
   - **FR12**: The system’s documentation **must** integrate references to user-provided requirements, explaining how the generated code satisfies them.

5. **Validation and Logging**  
   - **FR13**: The system **must** log each agent action (file creation, commit, push, template retrieval) for traceability.  
   - **FR14**: The system **must** handle errors gracefully (e.g., failed Git push, invalid file paths) and report them to the user.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**  
   - The agent should complete standard repository creation, template application, and commits within an acceptable time (e.g., under 30 seconds for typical templates).

2. **Scalability**  
   - Must allow for additional or custom templates without large architectural changes.  
   - Support new programming languages by adding templates and minimal new code.

3. **Security**  
   - All credentials for Git and LLM providers must be stored securely (e.g., environment variables, secret management).  
   - No tokens or keys should be exposed in logs or version control.

4. **Maintainability**  
   - Code should be modular, separating Git operations, file handling, and LLM logic.  
   - The RAG or template store should be replaceable with minimal refactoring.

5. **Usability**  
   - The agent must accept requirements in natural language or structured format.  
   - Command-line or API-level instructions should be intuitive (e.g., “Create a new Python microservice with endpoints X, Y, Z”).

---

## 10. Open Questions

1. **Remote Repository Creation**  
   - Should the agent also create new remote repositories (e.g., via GitHub API), or only manage local/remote sync?  
2. **Advanced Linting**  
   - Do we want an automatic code lint or formatting step included in the generation process?  
3. **Interactive Clarifications**  
   - To what extent should the agent prompt the user for additional details (e.g., library versions, project names) if unclear?

### Conclusion

With the additional requirement that the agent **autonomously generates all necessary source code and documentation** and enforces 
compliance with **language-specific project templates**, this updated PRD provides a clear set of objectives. The LLM-Based Git Repository 
Creation Agent will drastically reduce the manual effort required to spin up new projects, ensuring **both** requirement 
fulfillment **and** architectural consistency across different languages and teams.
